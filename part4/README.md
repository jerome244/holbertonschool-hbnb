## üõ† Setup & Installation

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerome244/holbertonschool-hbnb.git
```

### 2. **Set up the Backend and Frontend**
Navigate to the `part4` directory and follow the installation steps:
```bash
cd holbertonschool-hbnb/part4
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
export FLASK_APP=run.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

### 4. **Recreate the Database (Fresh Start)**
If you want to reset and start with a clean database:

```bash
rm -f instance/development.db
rm -rf migrations
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial"
flask db upgrade
flask init-db
```
This process will:

### 5. **Login**

After all of that try to login with the default admin user:
  - **Email**: `admin@hbnb.io`

## üö® Security Recommendations

1. **CORS Configuration:**
   - For development, CORS is enabled, but you should **restrict origins** in production for better security.

```python
CORS(app, origins=["https://yourdomain.com"])
```

## üöÄ Features

1. **Login (JWT Authentication)**
   - Login to the application with JWT-based authentication.
   - The token is stored in a cookie to manage user sessions.

   - Filters are available to view the places by price and location.
   - The four Newest and Top-Rated places sections.

3. **Place Details**
   - Clicking on a place provides detailed information about that place including reviews and amenities.
   - An interactiive map for geolocalising an address.
   - A photo carousel for swiping the place photos.

4. **Add Reviews**
   - Authenticated users can add reviews to places they have visited.

5. **User Profile**
	- User can edit its profile's picture, informations.
	- consult the place owner profile.

6. **Dashboard**

	cancel them, place visits.

7. **Admin: Manage Amenities and Grant Users to Admins**
   - Admin can manage amenities available for places and Users.

8. **Visitors Views counting system**
	- A visited place increments a counter reported in the place owners Dashboards. This counter isn't affected by the place owner visit.

9. **A Messaging system**
	- Send and receive messages beween users with a listing of chat threads.

10. **Reset DB Command**
   - Use `flask init-db` to reset the database and recreate the default admin.

## üöß Things Not Fully Implemented

- **Notifications:**
   - The notification feature currently do not work.

- **Future Features:**
   - Ideas for improving features like **Follow/Unfollow Functions**, **Report System**, **Block Users**, **Forum**, **Choice of Main Place Photo**, **Option for Changing the Language**, or either a **Dark Mode**.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº Testing Instructions

1. **For Testing Reviews:**
   - A Place must be already created first, for that you must create an User, in Dashboard click on "Add a new place" button, then accept to become a Host. After that return to Dashboard a try to re-create a place, fill the asked informations.

   - After that you must create a second User account. You will see the earlier created place, you can consultate its details page, then you can now **book** it. A booking request will be sent to the place owner (the Host).

   - Return to the Host account, go to Dashboard, then a new button appears "Manage booking requests". Click on it and accept the booking request.

   - Come back to User account, in Dashboard access to My Bookings, you can now see your accepted booking, and Leave a Review. The note will impacts the place rate note on the global places classement and will appear on its details consultable by Users or visitors without registration.
   

2. **For Admin Access:**
   - Log in as an admin (`admin@hbnb.io`, password `admin1234`).
   - To manage amenities go to the **Admin Manage Amenities** section in the green `admin` header tab.
   - Admins can view all users, add amenities, and grant admin access to other users.

## üß† Critique on Project Structure

- **Modularization Needed:**
   - It would be better to modularize the code, breaking down the large components into smaller, reusable components. This would improve the maintainability of the project.

- **Clean Up Uploaded Photos Folder:**
   - Currently, there is no system to clean up the uploaded images in the `uploads/` folder, especially after places or user data are deleted. 
   - Implementing a function to periodically remove unused or orphaned image files would help in keeping the folder clean and manageable.
